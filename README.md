# S&Box Projects

I am currently learning how to use the game "S&Box" developed by Facepunch, which is based on the Source Engine 2. In this repository, I am sharing my learning process with S&Box, focusing on improving my knowledge of C#, Razor Pages, and SCSS.

## Projects

1. **HUD**
   - Description: The HUD currently displays a placeholder for health and armor, as well as the Steam name. Elements such as weapon name and ammunition are planned for future implementation.
